In your WordPress database, there must be two users, one of them being the ad-
ministrator. The administrator’s username can’t contain admin/Admin or admin-
istrator/Administrator (e.g., admin, administrator, Administrator, admin-123, and
so forth).

To make things simpler, you have to configure your domain name so it points to your
local IP address.
This domain name must be login.42.fr. Again, you have to use your own login.
For example, if your login is wil, wil.42.fr will redirect to the IP address pointing to
wil’s website.

The 'latest' tag is prohibited.
No password must be present in your Dockerfiles.
It is mandatory to use environment variables.
Also, it is strongly recommended to use a .env file to store
environment variables. The .env file should be located at the root
of the srcs directory.
Your NGINX container must be the only entrypoint into your
infrastructure via the port 443.
